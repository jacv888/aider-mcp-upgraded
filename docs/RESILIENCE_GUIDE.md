# Aider-MCP Resilience Enhancements Guide

## 1. Problem Description

Disconnections and interruptions in the Aider-MCP server environment can occur due to network instability, resource exhaustion, or unexpected server crashes. These disconnections disrupt AI coding workflows, causing loss of progress, degraded user experience, and increased manual recovery effort.

Common causes include:
- Transient network failures or latency spikes
- Server overload or memory pressure
- Unhandled exceptions or crashes in AI model processes
- Timeouts in long-running AI tasks

## 2. Solution Overview

The Aider-MCP resilience features are designed to minimize disconnection impact by improving fault tolerance, automatic recovery, and graceful degradation. These enhancements ensure continuous availability and reliability of AI coding services.

Key resilience goals:
- Detect and recover from disconnections automatically
- Maintain AI task state across interruptions
- Provide configurable retry and timeout policies
- Enable monitoring and alerting on resilience events

## 3. Feature Details

### Connection Watchdog

Monitors AI model connections and triggers automatic reconnection attempts on failure, reducing manual intervention.

### Task Checkpointing

Periodically saves AI task state to durable storage, allowing resumption from last checkpoint after a crash or restart.

### Retry Policies

Configurable retry logic for transient errors, including exponential backoff and maximum retry limits to avoid resource exhaustion.

### Timeout Management

Defines sensible timeouts for AI requests to prevent indefinite hangs and enable fallback strategies.

### Health Monitoring

Integrates with logging and metrics systems to track resilience-related events and system health indicators.

## 4. Installation Instructions

To add resilience features to an existing Aider-MCP server:

1. Update your Aider-MCP package to the latest version supporting resilience.
2. Enable resilience components in your server configuration (see Configuration Guide).
3. Restart the server to apply changes.
4. Verify resilience features are active via logs or monitoring dashboards.

## 5. Configuration Guide

Resilience settings are configurable via the server's main configuration file or environment variables:

- `RESILIENCE_ENABLED` (bool): Enable or disable resilience features.
- `RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (int): Maximum retry attempts for transient failures.
- `RETRY_BACKOFF_BASE` (float): Base delay in seconds for exponential backoff.
- `TASK_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` (int): Interval in seconds between task state saves.
- `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT` (int): Timeout in seconds for AI model connections.
- `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` (int): Frequency in seconds for health monitoring checks.

Adjust these values based on your deployment environment and workload characteristics.

## 6. Monitoring and Troubleshooting

- Check server logs for resilience events such as reconnection attempts, retries, and checkpoint saves.
- Use integrated metrics dashboards to monitor connection stability and task progress.
- Enable debug logging for detailed trace of resilience operations.
- Common log messages to watch:
  - "Connection lost, attempting reconnect"
  - "Task checkpoint saved successfully"
  - "Retrying AI request, attempt X of Y"

## 7. Performance Impact

Resilience features introduce modest overhead due to checkpointing and retry logic. Typical impact includes:

- Slight increase in CPU and memory usage for state management
- Additional network traffic during reconnection attempts
- Minimal latency added by retry backoff delays

Overall, the benefits of improved uptime and reliability outweigh these costs in most scenarios.

## 8. Best Practices

- Enable resilience in all production deployments to prevent unexpected downtime.
- Tune retry and timeout settings conservatively to balance responsiveness and resource use.
- Use checkpoint intervals appropriate to task duration; shorter intervals for long-running tasks.
- Monitor resilience metrics regularly to detect and address emerging issues early.

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue                          | Possible Cause                  | Recommended Action                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Frequent reconnection attempts | Network instability             | Check network health and firewall rules |
| Task state not restoring       | Checkpointing disabled or failing | Verify checkpoint storage permissions and paths |
| High retry counts              | Persistent AI model errors     | Investigate AI model logs and inputs  |
| Timeouts on AI requests        | Overloaded server or slow model | Increase timeout or scale resources   |

## 10. Advanced Configuration Examples

### Example: Aggressive Retry with Short Backoff

```yaml
RESILIENCE_ENABLED: true
RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS: 10
RETRY_BACKOFF_BASE: 0.5
CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: 15
TASK_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL: 30
```

### Example: Conservative Retry with Long Checkpoints

```yaml
RESILIENCE_ENABLED: true
RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS: 3
RETRY_BACKOFF_BASE: 2.0
CONNECTION_TIMEOUT: 60
TASK_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL: 300
```
