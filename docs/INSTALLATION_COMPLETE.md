5. **Added monitoring threads** that run in background

## 🚀 Ready for Testing:

The server is now protected against:
- ❌ Resource exhaustion from parallel processing
- ❌ Connection timeouts and disconnections  
- ❌ Cascade failures
- ❌ Memory/CPU overload
- ❌ Unhandled errors causing crashes

## 📊 Configuration Files:
- Primary config: `/Users/jacquesv/MCP/aider-mcp/.env`
- Backup config: `/Users/jacquesv/MCP/aider-mcp/.env.resilience`
- Original server backup: `aider_mcp.py.bak`

The enhanced server is ready for production use with improved stability and automatic recovery capabilities!
